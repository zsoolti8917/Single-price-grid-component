## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I enjoyed doing this project it was a good practice for a grid layout i think it was nothing complicated but sure that my code is very beginner and it could be much much improved, anyways i am happy with the outcome and i plan to redo it when i start to learn REACT and scss. it was a fun quick project. and i am happy i could do it. Furthermore i was very excited because now that i finsihed this comes the last Newbie project from the free ones and then i can continue with the junior ones, i feel very proud of myself and i am ready to continue my journey!

### Continued development

I do not intend to make any further additions to this project as I believe it is complete, and I am satisfied with the outcome. I am committed to advancing my skills and knowledge by embarking on new projects and honing my abilities.
